There are hundreds of songs praising women, and it is idolatry. These songs sing about how beautiful women are, how one would die for them. They ask for forgiveness from women and talk about how they're nothing without them... idolatry! All praise belongs to God, and only He is worthy of praise. Love songs are nothing but the hymns of the synagogue of women, and it is idolatry. Behold:</P>

And many more examples can be found, for indeed, we see many of the same themes of praise music in love songs. Why? Because love songs are idolatry! It is the praise of women! God will not give his glory to another (<A HREF="bib/exo20v3t5.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</A>, <A HREF="bib/isa42v8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</A>, <A HREF="bib/isa48v11.htm">Isaiah 48:11</A>). Behold, the Lord is a jealous God (<A HREF="bib/exo20v5.htm">Exodus 20:5</A>). How, then, shall we expect to be guiltless upon praising women in the same way we praise God? Therefore I exhort thee to

<LI>Recognize the idolatry of love songs, and reprove them. Ephesians 5:11

Indeed, reprove love songs for what they are, idolatry. They are unfruitful, for women are nothing; our help is of God (<A HREF="bib/pss60v12.htm">Psalms 60:12</A>). And they are works of darkness, for praise is of the Lord alone, and the Lord our God is a jealous God (<A HREF="bib/exo20v5.htm">Exodus 20:5</A>).

<LI><P>Avoid <A HREF="https://jesus-is-savior.com/Evils%20in%20America/devils_music_no_effect.htm" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">love songs</A> and although this is hard, for it seems as though nearly all songs are love songs nowadays, it is not good that thou listen to the hymns of the synagogue of women. Would thou, a Christian, feel comfortable listening to muslim prayers 24/7? Doth thou suppose this would harm thy relationship with the one true God? And although, yea, thou can listen to these prayers and not commit idolatry, for thou art only listening to them, thou should be wary that these prayers do not influence thee away from God. Same it is for love songs. If thou listen too much to them, thou too will become influenced by these, and thy thoughts will go unto women.

<LI><P>Listen to Christian music, for it is the praise of God. Thus we shalt counter the worship of women of all the people of the earth.

<H2>More Evidence</H2><P>

Behold, back in the Middle Ages, nearly all music was religious, for they sung about what they held in highest esteem, the Lord. Nowadays, though, all songs are about women, and the reasoning is the same. For nowaydays, it is no longer the Almighty that we revere the most but <S>queef</S> women - shame on society!<P>

For indeed, we dedicate our efforts to that we hold on highest, whether it be the Lord, money, women, etc. And just as we ought not dedicate our life to the pursuit of money, we ought not dedicate our life to the pursuit of women. We ought dedicate our life to God! And we ought give our heart to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (not women).
