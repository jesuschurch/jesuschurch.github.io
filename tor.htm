The <A HREF="https://torproject.org">Tor Browser</A> is the best browser (followed by Netscape).<P>

<FONT COLOR="lime">&#10004;</FONT> <STRONG>Privacy</STRONG> - the Tor Browser is the best in terms of privacy. It can be used to counter government censorship, and the sites only available through the tor network (the deep web) are free of speech regulations. It it the true First Ammendment browser. Do you wish that all you post was tracked back to your IP? Use the Tor Browser, for otherwise, you're basically just giving that information away.<P>

<FONT COLOR="lime">&#10004;</FONT> <STRONG>Don't be a normie!</STRONG> <EM>Everyone</EM> uses Chrome; everyone's the same. Even if you use Microsoft Edge, it's based on Chromium, so it's basically Microsoft Chrome. Be different; be unique; be outside the herd; use the <A HREF="https://torproject.org">Tor Browser</A>.<P>

<FONT COLOR="lime">&#10004;</FONT> <STRONG>Access the deep web.</STRONG> The deep web is full of interesting stuff you'd otherwise never see. Sites are on the deep web for many reasons, such as avoiding government censorhip. If you access the deep web, you will be free of the clutches of Big Brother and be fully free to learn information.

Chrome is their <A HREF="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/" TITLE="Washingtom Post">tool</A>. Use Chrome and you're helping tech behemoth Google. Use MS Edge and you're funding Bill Gates.  Use the Tor Browser and they won't even know you exist, neither Google nor the advertisers they sell your information to.<P>


Here is my advice taken non-verbatim from Andrew Anglin:

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Always use the Tor Browser. Don't do anything online outside the Tor Browser that you wouldn't want linked back to you personally.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
