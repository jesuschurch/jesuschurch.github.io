<PRE><FONT FACE="serif">What would thou think
If I sinned against thee?
Would thou stand up
And give up on me?

Give me a chance,
And I'll sing thee a song,
And I'll try not
To sin against thee.

Oh, I get by
with a little help from the Lord.
Mmh, I get by
with a little help from the Lord.
Yes, I'm gonna try
with a little help from the Lord.

What do I do if my friend is away?
Does it worry thee to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Art thou sad because thou'rt on thine own?

No, I get by
with a little help from the Lord.
Mmh, I get by
with a little help from the Lord.
Oh, I'm gonna try
with a little help from the Lord.

Do ye need anybody?
The Lord we do need to love.
Could it be anybody?
I need the Lord above all.</FONT></PRE>

Yes, I'm certain that it's true all the time.
What doth thou see when thou turn'th off the lights?
I can't tell thee but I know it's fine.

Oh, I get by
with a little help from the Lord.
Mmh, I get by
with a little help from the Lord.
Yes, I'm gonna try
with a little help from the Lord.

from the Lord! (Aah)</FONT></PRE>
