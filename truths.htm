&nbsp; &nbsp; I am the only one in the world with a soul. Nobody is able to see what I see. I am truly enlightened, and if thou art here, thou too art enlightened. The world is made of brain-dead people who can't see beyond their phone screens. They are living an illusion, and they choose to delude themselves. They can't see the obvious, but I can, and I do. They won't do or ever be anything with their lives. They will work on their little computer as they do now, watch TV as they do now, and die as they lived. They live pathetic little lives and I have no idea how anyone could be content with such.

</TD><TD WIDTH=50%><P ALIGN="justify">

&nbsp; &nbsp; Let me tell thee a big truth: man is a god. Like gods, man can create, and man can destroy. Man can build up, and man can tear down. Man can create his own people, and choose his own people, and guide his own people to greatness. Forests are burnt and rivers drained when Prometheus and Poseidon fight or when men fight. Famines strike and the earth shakes when Ceres and Hades fight or whem men fight. Man is a god.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Second, everyone is brain dead. Nobody but me has a soul. Nobody exists outside of their phones. That is their reality. Wherefore the world is mine.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Third, the vaccine is the Mark of the Beast and everyone sold their souls - idiots.

<P>
Public ligting is the removal of attention from the heavens to ourselves. The urbanite lives quickly and has no wisdom. He wrecks the stars with his lights and deprives himself of beauty, confining the beautiful night sky to his cellphone. Society is frankly retarded for doing that. I literally had an existential crisis upon seeing the vast night sky. Really, I felt so small and honestly afraid. I was no longer the god I had always been but so, so small. Or at least that's how I felt. Regardless, the urbanite man is deprived of that. The ancient was an astronomer, observing the sky's movements and patterns, observing constellations. The modern man? he has the moon, but he doesn't look at it; he looks at his phone. It is because of the phone that nobody objects to the loss of the night sky around them. They are too busy on their phones. In fact, chances are this may be the first time you have heard someone stand up to public lighting, the crime against mankind.

<P>
Now, you may have wondered while reading, "If we have not public lighting, how shall I drive at night?" Well, bluntly, to hell with cars, and freak the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution is the worst thing that has ever happened to mankind. Everyone's lives have been deprived of meaning, and man has been kidnapped from nature into desolate, urban lives.

<H2><A NAME="cars">Cars Are Evil</A></H2>

<P>
Everything would be better if we got rid of cars. People lived without cars for millenia, but now we're addicted to them. We're so far in, people can't even consider getting rid of them. Cars were never necessary to our happiness. In fact, nothing was ever necessary to our happiness but that found in nature. It's a radical claim, but it can be perfectly backed up.

<OL TYPE="I">
<LI><P>People have lived without cars for milennia, yet now, although we see its harrowing effects of cars on the environment (major cities are permanently gray and their very air causes cancer) we don't even consider getting rid of them. But the truth is, we must. People in cities are literally dying from smog-related lung diseases. What's worth more, cars or your life? Yet people often prefer to keep their cars.<P>

When I say people are addicted to their cars, I mean it literally. Drugs harm drug addict, yet the drug addict keeps coming back. Well, cars are killing the air, killing the plants, killing the planet, and killing <EM>you</EM>, yet you keep on using your car. Behold:<BR><BR>

<P>Our society is cancer.
<LI>
<P>
Now, perhaps people <EM>do</EM> need cars. Perhaps society <EM>is</EM> shapes in a way wherein cars <EM>are</EM> necessary. But thus we see what's wrong with society. For behold, imagine cocaine was legal in the olympics. Soon, the olympics would become a contest of who could snort the most cocaine before runs, thus cocaine has been made necessary, and there is something wrong with the olympics. For to damage your body has become necessary, and it has become unpractical to try to be part of the olympics (society) without using cocaine (cars). Thus we realize that the only way to make it fair and save the runners from overdozing is too illegalize cocaine in the olympics. In other words, illegalize cars.<P>

Behold, just because an invention is optional upon its release does not mean it will stay optional. One may have said "No one is required to buy a car; it is an purely optional tool." But soon, infrastructure is set up for cars, and having cars is no longer a choice. And although one may use public transportation, the liberty of that individual is affected by technological advancement (Idea taken from <A HREF="https://dailystormer.in/industrial-society-and-its-future-by-ted-kaczynski" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Industrial Society and Its Future by Ted Kaczynski</A> <A HREF="http://stormer5v52vjsw66jmds7ndeecudq444woadhzr2plxlaayexnh6eqd.onion/industrial-society-and-its-future-by-ted-kaczynski" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer"><FONT COLOR="#ffccff">[tor]</FONT></A>, parragraph 127).<P>

Now, let me make myself clear: you do <EM>not</EM> need a car. Walk, go on a bicycle, save yourself! Man was not made to sit for so long, and to be constanstly moving means you shall outlive all those around you and become twice the men they are.

As said above, nothing around you is real. And indeed, people spend their lives deluding themselves. You know what the difference between modern and ancient tenchology is? Modern technology is made to fool our brains. None of your games are real; you are not really street racing. Get out there and do it for real, coward! Everyones' life is fake because technology is made to deceive our brains. It's called <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_stimulus">supernormal stimulus</A>.<P>

Behold, you're subconscious does not know what's on a screen or not. There is no biological instinct to detect that. "Evolution" doesn't go that fast. Why do you get scared upon seeing a jumpscare? It's just an animation. Behold, your consciense knows it's just a screen, but how can your natural, instinct-driven subconscious know? It doesn't. Why do you think you get aroused upon seeing nudity on a screen? They're not there; you can't copulate with them. It's because your brain can't tell the difference. Why am I telling you this? To inform you you are constantly deceiving your brain. You are on an <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernormal_stimulus#In_biology">artificial egg</A>, the matrix, a delusion.

<H2><A NAME="phones">Phones Are Gay</A></H2>

<P>
Nobody exists to me. I go hang out with friends, they do nothing but look at their phones. It's so retarded. You talk to them; they wait two seconds, look up at you, say "What?"; you tell them again, they look back at their phones, and answer  "Oh, cool". People are addicted to their phones. Please refer to the <A HREF="#table">table</A> above. The same applies for phone users: just replace "car" with "phone". Also, nothing they see on their screen is real. What is happening around them <EM>is</EM> real. They are deluding their brains, and they are living a lie. No wonder modern lives are so void of purpose. <A HREF="http://toastytech.com/about/smartphones.html">This guy</A> explains it better than I do.
