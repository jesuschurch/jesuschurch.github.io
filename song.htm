<PRE>
What would thou think
If I sinned against thee?
Would thou stand up
And give up on me?

Give me a chance,
And I'll sing thee a song,
And I'll try not
to sin against thee.

Oh, I get by
with a little help from the Lord.
Mmh, I get by
with a little help from the Lord.
Oh, I'm gonna try
with a little help from the Lord.

Do ye need anybody?
The Lord we need to love.
Could it be anybody?
I need the Lord above all.

Would thou believe in the Lord and His might?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time.
What doth thou see when thou turn'th off the lights?
I can't tell thee but I know it's fine.

Oh, I get by
with a little help from the Lord.
Mmh, I get by
with a little help from the Lord.
Yes, I'm gonna try
with a little help from the Lord.

Yes, I get by with a little help
from the Lord,
with a little help
from the Lord! (Aah)
