<P>Where is <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</A>? Where is <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Hefner">Hugh Hefner</A>? Where is <A HREF="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Goldstein">Al Goldenstein</A>? They are all BURNING IN HELL rightn now.They hearkened not unto it, but that was their demise. It also was the demise of many others. But God brought justice upon them, and none of them standeth today. The Lord brought upon them His righteous Judgement.
<P>Hugh Heffner won a lot of money, but do you think he cares about any of it now? No, he is too busy worrying about the heat of the fire burning without consuming him to be glad over riches. If anything, he's just regretting the foolish, sinful decisions he made. You do NOT want to end up like him.

<P>What will you be remembered as? What will you think of yourself as? What do you think of yourself as <EM>right now?</EM> It best be something good, because you could die tomorrow. Life is short. You better get things right with God before it's too late. Alma 34:33-35

&nbsp;33 And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.<P>


&nbsp;34 Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my G-d. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.<P>

&nbsp; 35 For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power of you; and this is the final state of the wicked.
