First off, to all you people who took got vaccinated:<BR>
You have not taken the Mark of the Beast.<BR>
You probably won't resist the real Mark of the Beast.<BR>
You <EM>will</EM> have to explain to God what you did.<BR>
But worry not, you have not taken the Mark of the Beast.

If people were smart, they would all be clamoring to build up local parallel systems to make the mark impossible...

We know what happened with the vaccine. It is now obvious that all it takes for everyone to take the Mark of the Beast is a fake virus. All you vaxies may not remember, but I remember well all the "Krispy Kreme donuts!" and "free service at brothels!" if you get vaccinated. This was meant to made people crack, and for some people, it worked. The tribulation when the Mark is come will be much greater! One who succumbed to this tribulation shall certainly not stand for the real tribulation. And to all the people who got it due to peer pressure, of course you're not gonna survive the Mark of the Beast.

If some group of hidden people wanted to infect/mark/test the entire global population, what would they have done differently to what has already happened with COVID?

The Bible predicts the Mark of the Beast, and the vaccine passport is basically proto-Mark of the Beast. There will be several other plandemics in order for them to justify bringing about greater tyranny. Covid was released in order to sh*t-test humanity, to see how much they are willing to put up with before we decide its too much tyranny and resist with united noncompliance. [never happened]

<P>I don't mean that there is a precursor to the Mark of the Beast in the Bible, I mean that the vaccine passport is proto Mark of the Beast.
<P>If I wanted the world's population to be chipped (Mark of the Beast), I would cause a pandemic and get people used to the idea of having to use health passports in order to participate with parts of the economy (vaccine passport).
<P>And in the next plandemic, we will drift closer to the Mark of the Beast, perhaps digital IDs will be tried on us, as well as locking people out of their bank accounts for "public health disinfo". For the good of our community.

It is the mark. This was revealed to me when I got the first jab. Almost immediately, I "heard" a voice cry out "why?" And then it was as if time stood still, I was blinded by a piercing white light, and the voice spoke again to tell me that the end times are upon us, and that I was a fool, that the Lord has such high hopes for me but I've been marked with half of the number of the beast. Then, time returned to normal, I could see again, and I resolved to not get the second shot. The damage is done, but I can at least repent while I still have the time to do so.

That's crazy, dude. I know it sounds crazy, but I exhort everyone to not take it for granted due to it sounding crazy, for the entire book of Revelations sounds "crazy" to people. I mean, I guess, whatever of what he may have heard or seen, the Bible is clear on the subject, so if it doesn't fit the description, we can basically neglect such accounts (but I'd keep it in mind. Either way I'm not vaxxed, so thank God).</P>

<P>they have no strength. most christians took it because fear of social ostracization >>> any real belief they had in 'the mark of the beast' and so on. churchians just pretend. almost nobody takes the bible seriously anymore (or any other religion) because if they did, they'd get waco'd or terror suspected.
<P>i think that donald trump was the anti-christ because everyone was fooled by him. you either hated him because he was a super bad man (wasn't) or loved him because he said what no one else could (still didn't do anything about it though). both sides were fooled. almost nobody had no opinion.
<P>elon musk is probably the false prophet because he's pretending to be free speech, and replacing nasa (gonna bring us star trek peace and prosperity lol) and is making all these green technology thingies that just so happen to be absolutely perfect for central control.
<P>covid vax is perfectly the mark of the beast.
<P>and as for people who say it wasn't big and bad enough... what makes you think this isn't fractal and the same pattern just keeps repeating and amplifying? they say the reason the devil lives forever is because otherwise one generation of people would have had to suffer against him and the rest would have gotten off easy. the value of the bible is precisely the patterns that keep repeating. what is divinely inspired from all religions is where they illuminate the sins (vulnerabilities) we humans trip over again and again.
<P>all because we wanted to know of good and evil ourselves and by doing so, can never completely trust God. we must live with the seed of doubt that "maybe God is bad" and so... we are left with our own chaos while we all try to be what we can never.
