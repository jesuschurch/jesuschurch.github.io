Women do NOT Deserve Rights!
</FONT></H1><P>

Women have not had rights for the ENTIRETY of history. It has not been until the last hundred years that you have happened to have been born and that women have rights. For the entirety of the existence of the world, women have not had rights. And now, people are expected to believe that this is best for society, and that thus society will prosper. Well, actually women do NOT deserve rights, and guess what? The western countries of the last century have not found a truth never found before in the history of mankind. Women do NOT deserve rights!

<H2>WOMEN...</H2>
<DL>
<DT>Belong in the kitchen.
<DD>By Nature women are made to bear children, rear children, and take care of the family. That is <EM>by nature,</EM> not by human institution. For obviously women are the child-bearers, and they, <EM>by nature,</EM> have motherly instincts to protect their children and to take care of them. Take, for example, lions who are territorial, taller, and stronger while female lions are smaller and have sharp instincts to take care of her children.<P>

By nature women are not equal to men, and this has been obvious to everyone since antiquity. It has not been until the last century that we have strayed so far from nature that this obvious fact has been forgotten. But nature cannot be replaced without bringing great woes upon mankind, for God created nature And He saw that it was good, and man are not apart from nature but a part thereof.



<DT>Are weaker
<DD>Obviously, women are weaker, and anyone who has ever been in a sport knows this. Women and gay men have claimed women are only weaker because of social institutions, that there is nothing feminine about being weak, and that these are all man-made ideas. Well, obviously, that is simply not true! First off, by nature and across the animal kingdom, we see what is formally known as <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</A> which is the difference between genders among the same species. So female weakness is not a social institution made by men, but a biological fact. Second, (although they shouldn't) women have had rights for a long time and women's sport have existed for a long time; many women have been raised without any notion of being feminine, and yet women are still weaker. So obviously, it is not because of cultural reasons, but for biological reasons.<P>

Now, one may argue that strength is unrelated to whether women should have rights, but I pointed out the difference to introduce sexual dimorphism. For thus we realize that there <EM>are</EM> inborn differences between gender, amongst these differences strength, and that is a biological fact. So women and men are not the same, despite what society has been brainwashed people to believe. (And yes, we have been brainwashed, for nearly everyone believes something contrary to nature, and it has been made taboo to believe otherwise.) And sexual dimorphism is obviously not limited to this only difference. So thus we realize that women are inferior in multiple aspects, and that such is the way of nature, and such is obvserved in animals, and since man is not separate from nature but a part thereof, man should not try to violate the laws of nature and create his own reality wherein women are equal. For if you tried to make a roach (obviously inferior) equal to man, you must bring down the power of man to equate them to those of the roach (women), and thus you have created a dystopic nightmare wherein roaches have equal rights to men and men are expected to believe the delusion that roaches are equal to men which is obviously not true and is contrary to nature.

<DT>Should not vote
<DD>In a democracy (cringe), everyone is a leader (technically), for everyone votes and thus influences the desicions of the nation. People who vote are put in a position of power, wherefore  to vote has been reserved to certain people since the inception of democracy. Aliens have not been allowed to vote, for what if a thousand persians came to athens to vote for the worst candidate? It would be to allow the enemy to hijack the government. Wherefore we realize that universal suffrage is obviously flawed, and this realized the creators of democracy milennium ago.<P>

So, now, if we put women in charge, we are putting a people inferior by birth in charge of the country. Why put inferior people in power instead of the best? Even the Founding Fathers realized this, for they wrote <I>All <STRONG>men</STRONG> are created equal.</I> For obviously, by nature, women are inferior, and the Founding Fathers did not delude themselves as we do, for they were closer to nature, and they were thinking men. Any thinking men realizes women are inferior.

<DT>Posses not leader qualities
<DD>It is an inbred part of the female gender that they seek to protect their children as well as the desire to be protected by their mate. It is their natural inclination to seek to avoid danger and to deliver her children from danger. Therefore, it is part of their psychology to avoid danger. Therefrom it makes sense why women tend to vote for democrats. They greatly oppose guns, for they are dangerous, and indeed, many women oppose guns. They greatly agree with immigration, for it is their nature to keep people safe, and people on boats isn't safe. They wish for health care and other social aid projects, for it is their nature to supply for all her children. Behold, thus we have explained women's voting patterns.<P>

Now, these voting patterns may not seem that bad, specially if you're a left winger, and just seem as another equally valuable point of view to bring to the table... wrong! We thus realize that women tend to vote as they do due to their motherly psychological inclinations which are coded into the female gender. So, will we have a nation ruled by women with their motherly instincts, or a nation ruled by men with their philosophy and thoughts like the Founding Fathers? And indeed, voting for a women is like voting for a mommy to protect you. Just as your mother took away scissors from your hands, voting women are taking guns from your hands. Just as your mother took away your toys to share with your brothers, voting women are taking your money for the poor. Behold, we are being ruled by women with their motherly instincts to protect us by treating us like children! We have feminine leaders ruling over us with feminine instincts, and we are voting for these women to be our mommies! That is <EM>not</EM> a government, and that is <EM>not</EM> the government the Founding Father intended for. Governments need to take risks. Governments need to stimulate economic growth. Governments need to provide freedoms, and people need freedoms. And governments need to tell immgirants to <A HREF="https://www.bitchute.com/video/LdVFb4InSSwQ/" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">get the heck out!</A>

<H2>Afterword</H2><P>

Please do not disregard my message because it is socially unacceptable to question women's authority. And please do not disregard my message due to the lack of formality, for such was necessary for my rhetoric. Please <EM>do</EM> take these truths into account and ponder upon them, and feel free to share them, for only the truth will set us free.<P>
