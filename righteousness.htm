<P>Listen brother, you do NOT have sin to be happy. In fact, the opposite is true. Sin is the way to unhappiness. It is the way to a debauched, broken, and hell-bound life.

That is, if you lead a <A HREF="javascript:void(0)" ONCLICK="alert(this.title);" TITLE="Only seeking pleasure as the ultimate goal of life">hedonistic</A> life, you will always be looking for more food, more sex, more partners, more entertainment, more gambling, more praise, more cars, etc.  but you will never be filled. You will always feel empty, and you will never be satisfied. You will become gay, fat, ugly, debauched, and void of morals and purpose.  You will make a show where people really kill each other for your entertainment, yet you will not be satisfied.<P>

If you come unto Christ, though, and you are righteous, you will find great joy in keeping His Commandments. In your fasting you will find pleasure in pleasing the Lord, as you will in your charity and lovingkindness. Your purpose will always be clear: to seek the Kingdom of God and His Righteousness (<A HREF="javascript:void(0)" TITLE="But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall beadded unto you." ONCLICK="alert(this.title)">Matthew 6:33</A>).
